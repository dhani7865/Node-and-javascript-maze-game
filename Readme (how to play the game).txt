Node.js
In order to play this game, first thing which you would need to do is, run node.js in the command line. Download the Windows installer from the Nodes.js® web site, if you already havn't got it downloaded. 

Next, test Node. To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, In the command line tool, type node -v, in order to check what version node.js you are using. This should print a version number. For example, you’ll see something like this v0.10.35.

Next, test NPM. To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print NPM’s version number. For example, you will see you’ll see something like this 1.4.28. Next create a test file and run it. There is a shortcut availble which you can use, "shift, right click on the mouse and go to open in command line". 

Next, once node has been installed, type in the command line "node and then type in the file name which you would like to run". For eexample, "node server.js", in order to run the server for playing the maze game. 

Maze game:
Once you have run the server, in the command line it will tell you to type in localhost:8081 in the web browser, then you are ready to play the game.The controls which you can use to play the game are; left arrow key or "A" to move the player to the left. Up arrow key or "W" to move the player up. Right arrow key or "D" to move the player to the right. Down arrow key or "S" to move the player down. There is also mouse control or touch control to move the player. Simply, just move the mouse around and it will move the player where ever you would like it to go, in the maze. For the touch controls, you can use the buttons which I have added to the game.
