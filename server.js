 * - mazeSize
 * -- rows, the number of rows in the maze
 * -- cols, the number of columns in the maze
 *
 * - mazeCells, a two-dimensional array of objects each containing members:
 * -- x, an integer describing the horizontal position of the cell
 * -- y, an integer the vertical position of the cell
 * -- top, a boolean describing whether the top edge of the cell has a wall
 * -- bottom, a boolean describing whether the bottom edge of the cell has a wall
 * -- left, a boolean describing whether the left edge of the cell has a wall
 * -- right, a boolean describing whether the right edge of the cell has a wall
 * -- set, an integer used in maze generation that can safely be ignored
 *
 * - mazeStart
 * -- x, the row at which players should start in the maze
 * -- y, the column at which players should start in the maze
